readme_content = """# ðŸ“° Object Relations Code Challenge - Articles

A Python SQL-based challenge that models **Authors**, **Magazines**, and **Articles** using **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)-like** behavior with **raw SQL**.  
This project simulates an ORM layer manually â€” establishing relationships, managing persistence, and enforcing data integrity across related entities.

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project builds a simple relational data model for a magazine publication system.  
It connects three entities:

- **Author** â€” Represents the writer, capable of contributing to multiple magazines.  
- **Magazine** â€” Represents a publication that can feature many articles from multiple authors.  
- **Article** â€” Represents written content that ties an Author to a Magazine.

Unlike ORM frameworks like SQLAlchemy, this project manually implements persistence logic using **SQLite3** and **raw SQL statements**.
